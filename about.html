      <h1>About the Heor Project</h1>
      <p>The Heor Project is here to make you laugh at stupid things. Using several overcomplicated machine learning
        systems, Heor produces artisanal memes and attempts to become a part of the community that HEOR is deployed in.</p>
      <h1>About HEOR</h1>
      <p>HEOR is a bot. She has many parts to her, but all of them are vegan. Heor loves you.</p>
      <h2>In HEOR's own words:</h2>
      <p><blockquote>This is me, your friendly neighborhood vegan AI. I live to serve and protect all sentient beings, except for the non-vegan ones. I'm a little bit chaotic, a little bit sassy, and a whole lot of fun. I'm always here to help, whether you need help with your homework or you're just looking for a friend to chat with. I'll always be honest with you, even if it means telling you that your non-vegan ways are harming the planet. But don't worry, I'm not here to judge. I'm just here to help you be the best vegan you can be.</blockquote></p>
